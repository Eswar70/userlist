Explanation of Files and Folders
components/:

Contains all the React components for the project.
App.js: Main wrapper that manages state and renders child components.
UserList.js: Displays the list of users with options to edit or delete.
UserForm.js: Handles the form functionality for adding or editing a user.
ErrorBoundary.js: Catches and displays errors in the UI.
styles/:

Holds all CSS files for individual components and the global app.
services/:

Contains reusable API interaction logic (api.js).
index.js:

The entry point of the React application.
Components Explanation
1. App Component
Acts as the central state manager.
Fetches user data from the API during the initial load.
Passes data and handlers (e.g., onSubmit, onEdit, onDelete) to child components.
2. UserList Component
Displays users in a tabular format.
Includes "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for each user.
Provides pagination or infinite scrolling options for large data sets.
3. UserForm Component
Handles the form for adding or editing users.
Includes validation to prevent empty fields or unchanged data submission.
Communicates with the parent App component to update the user list.
4. ErrorBoundary Component
Wraps around critical components to catch rendering errors.
Displays a user-friendly message if any error occurs.
Challenges Faced
Dynamic ID Management:

Since the JSONPlaceholder API does not persist new data, ensuring unique IDs for new users was challenging.
Solution: Dynamically calculate the next ID using the maximum ID in the current user list.
Validation Logic:

Preventing form submission with unchanged or empty data required meticulous validation checks.
Solution: Added robust validation and state comparison in the UserForm component.
API Limitations:

The API is a mock server that does not persist data across sessions.
Solution: Simulated additions and updates by modifying local state after API requests.
Potential Improvements
Real Backend Integration:

Replace JSONPlaceholder with a real backend to persist user data and improve functionality.
Better Form Handling:

Use libraries like Formik or react-hook-form for cleaner and more scalable form handling.
Global State Management:

Implement Redux or Context API for better state management, especially as the app scales.
Enhanced UI:

Use a UI library like Material-UI or Ant Design for better styling and responsiveness.
Testing:

Add unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure reliability.
User Feedback:

Implement toast notifications or modals for successful/failed operations instead of plain alerts.
